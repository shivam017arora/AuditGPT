## AI Auditing

The motivation for focusing on catching bugs in Smart Contracts stems from the inherent fallibility of human beings and the recognition that mistakes are bound to happen. Given the increasing prevalence and importance of Smart Contracts in today's world, it becomes even more crucial to address and rectify these errors. Smart Contracts, which are immutable agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code, have gained significant traction across various industries. Recognizing this vulnerability, the motivation arises to proactively identify and rectify errors in Smart Contracts.
